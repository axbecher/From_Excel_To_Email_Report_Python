## Installation & Usage

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

``` 
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Change your current working directory to the root of the cloned repository:

```
cd <repository-directory>
```

### Step 3: Create the Virtual Environment

Run the following command to create a new virtual environment named `myvenv`:

```
python -m venv myvenv
```

This will create a new directory called `myvenv` in your project directory, containing all the necessary files for a virtual environment.

### Step 4: Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment using one of the following commands based on your operating system:

On Windows:

```
myvenv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux:

```
source myvenv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, you will see `(myvenv)` in your command prompt, indicating that you are working within the virtual environment.

### Step 5: Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment active, install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will ensure that all the necessary packages are installed within the virtual environment.

### Step 6: Run `run_generate_report.py`

Now that the virtual environment is set up and the required dependencies are installed, you can run the `run_generate_report.py` script using the following command:

```
python run_generate_report.py
```


The script will now be executed within the virtual environment, utilizing the installed dependencies.

### Step 7: Deactivate the Virtual Environment

Once you have finished running the script and no longer need the virtual environment, you can deactivate it using the following command:

```
deactivate
```

This will return you to your system's default Python environment.

## Customization
You can modify the following parameters in the credentials/config.py file:

- `url`: OneDrive API link to the Excel file containing the weapon data.
- `sender_email`: Email address from which the report will be sent.
- `sender_password`: Password for the sender's email account.
- `receiver_email`: Email address of the recipient.
- `cc_email`: Email address of the recipient to be carbon-copied.
- `subject`: Subject of the email.
- `body`: Body text of the email.
### Additionally, you can customize the charts generated by the script by modifying the corresponding functions in main.py.

# Bash script in order to run this script when windows boots up
